## Embedding the keyboard in own website
[GreyWywern's Virtual Keyboard Interface improved and extended](https://github.com/pod-o-mart/vki) including a mobile version.

The **quick and dirty method** to embed one of the three keyboards "as is", is to add following lines to the `<head>` section of your website:
 
 **Universial keyboard**
```
 <script src="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/kb.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <link href="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/keyboard.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
 ```
 
 **Slavonic studies keyboard**
```
 <script src="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/kb-slav.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <link href="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/kb-slav.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
 ```
  **East European studies keyboard**
```
 <script src="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/keyboard-ees.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <link href="https://pod-o-mart.github.io/keyboardBookmarklets/keyboard-ees.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
 ```
